What is SMART Restuarants?

The idea for this project is to develop SMART restaurants for our region. 
We define SMART restaurants by automating repetitive tasks among employees. 
The target audience are local and franchise restaurants that want to transition to a modern and technological environment. 
An example of an automated task is the traditional way of ringing up a food order. 
A SMART restaurant would give the opportunity to the customer to push their orders or use voice recognition to 
send an order to the cook.
